#COMP 2106 – Lab 1 – Rock Paper Scissors

Write a JavaScript program that allows the user to play Rock Paper Scissors.

The Program should ask the user if they want to choose rock, paper or scissors. A computer should be randomly assigned one of the three choices.

Winning combinations are as follows:
•	Rock beats Scissors
•	Scissors beats Paper
•	Paper beats Rock.
The program should indicate who the winner was. This program should be written in vanilla javascript (No libraries). 
The code can either be 
A: intended for the browser, in which case an index.html file should be included which includes a script src to the program. 
B: intended for node, in which case the code should be able to be run by typing node (your_file).js in the terminal, and the program will run inside the terminal.
The program should also handle the following issues:
•	The player choosing an invalid option.
•	Handling a tie (rethrow)

BONUS:
The program should ask the user if they want to play again, and when the user says no. It should print out the scores of wins/losses/ties.
